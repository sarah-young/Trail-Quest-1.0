Day One:

AM:
I'm currently looking for data to be used in the trail selector. I'm finding that when data exists, there isn't usually an API.
I'm hopeful that I can use the API for recreation.gov, but I've come across some broken links that has dead-ended a couple branches of my search.

Current list:
[X] Transit & Trails - good data, but very limited (just the Bay Area)
[✔️] Recreation.gov - looking at this currently; data may be limited.
[X] Hiking Project - looking at this currently; data may not be available?
[X] ARCGIS - looks promising??? 

Current available data:

API documentation: https://usda.github.io/RIDB/#Trails
Forest Service Trails: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/trails/USFS/
FWS Trails: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/trails/FWS/

Pagination example: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/recareas?offset=100&limit=25


PM:

I found data on through the recreation.gov API and I've been able to pull information about trails from the USFS & FWS.

I want to see if there's a way to:
1A.) Link pages to pages with more information (dogs, wildlife, etc)
1B.) Link pages to a Google Search
2.) Show the trails outlined on a Google Map

NEW STRATEGY: Use Yelp API as it includes all the information that I want.
STRETCH GOAL: Use image analyzing API in conjunction with Yelp API to give user more information about the trail.
