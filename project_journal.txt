Day Three:

AM: 

Set up Flask, server.py, and created a functions folder.

PM:

Jinja pages work! Flask debugged! Given a city & state the app will display three trails. 

Lacking: 

> Database for selected trails.

#########################

Mentor meeting journal (Day 2 continued...)

Put together search.py. Search logic and API configuration works!!!

Day Two: 

AM: 

Decided against using Yelp API due to lack of things like trail length.
Today, I'm looking at Hiking Project that is working today (yay!).
In addition, I may want to use USFS data as they have interesting things like map coordinates. 

My goals for the day:

> seed database
> figure out logic for calculating zip code from lat/long of a trail

Next steps after this will be creating the web framework for this:
> user enters zip code, trail(s) returned


Phase 3 brainstorming #phasethree

Verifying location from photo geotag?
https://www.howtogeek.com/211427/how-to-see-exactly-where-a-photo-was-taken-and-keep-your-location-private/


PM: 

JSONified starting data. I'm not sure if I need to create a database or if I should request from the API from the web app. (Asking ed staff)

Answer from ed staff: Information should be stored in addition to the json strings (separate table).

Next steps:
> Seeding data
>> This will be done as the users review and upload information about the trail due to unknown API constraints.

> Figuring out how to unpack the return from Google Map's geocode API.
>> Need the location lat/long (buried in a long json return)

Day One:

AM:
I'm currently looking for data to be used in the trail selector. I'm finding that when data exists, there isn't usually an API.
I'm hopeful that I can use the API for recreation.gov, but I've come across some broken links that has dead-ended a couple branches of my search.

Current list:
[X] Transit & Trails - good data, but very limited (just the Bay Area)
[✔️] Recreation.gov - looking at this currently; data may be limited.
[X] Hiking Project - looking at this currently; data may not be available?
[X] ARCGIS - looks promising??? 

Current available data:

API documentation: https://usda.github.io/RIDB/#Trails
Forest Service Trails: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/trails/USFS/
FWS Trails: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/trails/FWS/

Pagination example: GET https://ridb.recreation.gov/api/v1/recareas?offset=100&limit=25


PM:

I found data on through the recreation.gov API and I've been able to pull information about trails from the USFS & FWS.

I want to see if there's a way to:
1A.) Link pages to pages with more information (dogs, wildlife, etc)
1B.) Link pages to a Google Search
2.) Show the trails outlined on a Google Map

NEW STRATEGY: Use Yelp API as it includes all the information that I want.
STRETCH GOAL: Use image analyzing API in conjunction with Yelp API to give user more information about the trail.
